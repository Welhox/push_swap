# Push_swap

The art of pushing, and swapping. In other words, a sorting algorithm using two stacks.

# The rules

Only certain moves are allowed, mainly pushing from A to B or vice versa, and rotating the stacks either way, and rotating the two topmost numbers.

The algorithm should sort all numbers on A, using B as help. 

In this project I learnd about sorting algorithms (I used mechanical turk as my main algorithm), and mor in depths knowledge about linked lists. 

The progam outputs a stream of instructions, which should sort the numbers given.
